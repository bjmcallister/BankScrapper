# BankScrapper
BankScrapper (Python Version)

Code will be uploaded soon.

The idea is to have a program that will connect to multiple banks/ credit card
companies and grab the information such as due dates and amount due. Then add that
to an existing amount of money that is currently held in your primary bank account.

So far the program can gather the information from ChaseBank and Friendbank.

Estimated time of completion is January 2019 and will feature an interative GUI.
